## Usage  

### **1. Generating Waveforms**  
- The script uses PyCBC to generate both lensed and unlensed gravitational waveforms.  
- Configuration can be adjusted in the `waveform_generator.py` file.  

### **2. Training the Model**  
- The training script uses the generated waveforms to build the classification model.  
- Run the training process with:  
   ```bash  
   python train_model.py  
   ```  

### **3. Testing and Evaluation**  
- Test the model's accuracy using real-world or simulated data.  
- Results, including classification metrics and confusion matrices, will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Results  

- **Accuracy:** 98%  
- **Recall:** High recall ensures most gravitational waves are correctly classified.  
- **Insights:** Predicted source characteristics from the classified waveforms.
